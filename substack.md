Great. I’ll look into top Substack newsletters from a wide range of categories worldwide, with a focus on the last 3 years. I’ll gather data on their paid subscriber counts, pricing models, and estimated revenue. I’ll also identify popular trends and topics across these successful newsletters.

I’ll get back to you with a detailed overview, including statistics, notable examples, and any patterns in pricing or content strategy that emerge.

# Substack’s Growth and Top Newsletters (2022–2025)

Over the past three years, Substack has grown into a robust platform where individual writers can attract massive audiences – and significant revenue – through paid email newsletters. As of early 2025, **over 2 million** paid subscriptions have been recorded on Substack (up from 1 million in 2021) ([Substack User and Revenue Statistics (2024)](https://backlinko.com/substack-users#:~:text=Substack%20Usage%20Statistics%20)). The number of high-earning publications has surged: in 2023 there were 27 newsletters making at least **$500,000/year**, and by January 2025 that count had nearly doubled to **52 publications** collectively grossing a minimum of $40.2 million annually ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=This%20year%20that%20figure%20has,revenue%20publishers)). According to Substack, the **top 10 writers alone earn about $40 million per year** in total ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=This%20year%20that%20figure%20has,revenue%20publishers)) – averaging roughly $4 million each. This report analyzes the leading Substack newsletters across a range of topics, their subscriber numbers, pricing models, estimated revenues, and the trends behind their success.

## Subscriber Numbers and Paid vs. Free Tiers

Substack does not publicly release exact subscriber counts for each newsletter, but **leaderboard badges** give a rough sense of scale (e.g. “hundreds,” “thousands,” or “tens of thousands” of paid subscribers) ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=How%20did%20we%20produce%20our,Substack%20minimum%20revenue%20figures)). Many top newsletters also share milestones or have been profiled by the press, providing more concrete figures. Generally, successful Substacks build a large base of free readers and convert a fraction of them to paid subscribers – often via a “freemium” model of free posts plus paid-only content ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=More%20free%20subscribers%20leads%20to,more%20paid%20subscribers%2C%20too)). In fact, most popular publications have the vast majority of readers on the free list, yet still “thousands” or more who pay ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=)) ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=)). For example, historian **Heather Cox Richardson’s** newsletter *Letters from an American* has **over 1.3 million total subscribers**, of whom “hundreds of thousands” are paying ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=1)). This enormous free readership (in the high six figures) serves as a funnel to an equally massive paid base. By contrast, some newsletters with large subscriber counts remain mostly free (e.g. *Broken Palate* with ~981k subscribers but only “hundreds” paying) ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=2)) – highlighting that content strategy and paywall approach matter greatly.

**Table:** Examples of top Substack newsletters, with subscriber figures, pricing, and estimated annual gross revenue from subscriptions. (These estimates are based on publicly reported subscriber tiers and prices. Actual revenues may be higher, and Substack takes a 10% platform fee.)

As the table shows, *Letters from an American* and *The Free Press* are outliers with well into six-figure subscriber counts, translating to **eight-figure revenues**. Heather Cox Richardson’s newsletter – an accessible daily chronicle of U.S. political history in context – is the only Substack explicitly labeled as having “hundreds of thousands” of paying readers, implying at least 200,000 subscribers and *at least* $5 million/year in subscription fees ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=The%20Substack%20which%20topped%20Press,5m)). Bari Weiss’s *The Free Press*, an independent news outlet launched by a former New York Times columnist, has reported **136,000 paid subscribers** at about $80 annually ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=However%2C%20Cox%20Richardson%20now%20appears,its%20%2480%20yearly%20subscription%20price)) ([The End of the Subscription Era is Coming | by Nick Hilton | Medium](https://nickfthilton.medium.com/the-end-of-the-subscription-era-is-coming-ed197f252c6a#:~:text=called%20Slow%20Boring%20,a%20month%20subscription%20Weiss%20initially)), yielding roughly $10–11 million per year. (Indeed, *The Free Press* is likely Substack’s top revenue-generator, though it’s slightly atypical – it functions more like a media company with a team of writers, and Weiss raised outside investment to expand it ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20Bari%20Weiss%2C%20the,earns%20at%20least%20%24800%2C000%20annually)).)

Other leading newsletters operate as **solo ventures or small teams**. The tech-career newsletter *The Pragmatic Engineer*, for instance, has “tens of thousands” of paying subscribers and charges $15/month (or $150/year) for in-depth engineering management insights ([About The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about#:~:text=How%20much%20does%20it%20cost%3F,students%20and%20purchase%20pricing%20parity)). This places its subscriber count likely in the 20–30k range and revenue well over $1 million ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=joint,5m)). Similarly, *Lenny’s Newsletter* (on product management and growth) has converted about **4–5%** of its huge free audience (over 377k) into ~18k paying members ([Paid Newsletter Deep Dive: How Lenny Rachitsky Gets 18k People to Pay for His Content - Growth in Reverse](https://growthinreverse.com/lennys-paid-newsletter/#:~:text=those%20people%20into%20paying%20customers)) – enough to earn former Airbnb product lead Lenny Rachitsky an estimated **$2 million+** annually ([Paid Newsletter Deep Dive: How Lenny Rachitsky Gets 18k People to Pay for His Content - Growth in Reverse](https://growthinreverse.com/lennys-paid-newsletter/#:~:text=Lenny%20Rachitsky%20makes%20over%20%242,to%20his%20newsletter%20every%20year)). Political commentary by prominent journalists also thrives: Yglesias’s *Slow Boring* (pragmatic policy analysis) has ~18k paying at $80/yr ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=,4m)) ([The End of the Subscription Era is Coming | by Nick Hilton | Medium](https://nickfthilton.medium.com/the-end-of-the-subscription-era-is-coming-ed197f252c6a#:~:text=called%20Slow%20Boring%20,a%20month%20subscription%20Weiss%20initially)), and the center-right publication *Bulwark+* has on the order of 10–20k subscribers paying $100/yr, both generating roughly $1 million a year or more ([Substack User and Revenue Statistics (2024)](https://backlinko.com/substack-users#:~:text=Newsletter%20Annual%20subscription%20revenue%20Letters,Tipping%20Point%20Prophecy%20Update%20%24770%2C000)). These figures demonstrate that a **dedicated niche audience** can translate into a substantial income on Substack – enough to support full-time writing and even hire staff in some cases ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=The%2027%20highest,revenue%2C%20Press%20Gazette%20can%20reveal)).

## Pricing Models and Revenue Streams

**Subscription Pricing:** Most Substack newsletters use a **monthly or yearly subscription model**, often with a discount for annual plans. A common price point for politics and general-interest newsletters is around **$5–$8 per month (about $50–$80/year)**. For example, both *Slow Boring* and *The Free Press* are priced at **$8/month or $80/year** ([The End of the Subscription Era is Coming | by Nick Hilton | Medium](https://nickfthilton.medium.com/the-end-of-the-subscription-era-is-coming-ed197f252c6a#:~:text=called%20Slow%20Boring%20,a%20month%20subscription%20Weiss%20initially)). Many early Substack writers adopted the $5/month standard, though some have raised prices as their content and following grew (Weiss’s *Free Press* launched at $5 and later went to $8) ([The End of the Subscription Era is Coming | by Nick Hilton | Medium](https://nickfthilton.medium.com/the-end-of-the-subscription-era-is-coming-ed197f252c6a#:~:text=called%20Slow%20Boring%20,a%20month%20subscription%20Weiss%20initially)). More specialized business and tech publications tend to charge more – often **$10–$15/month** (e.g. *Noahpinion* at $10, *Lenny’s* at $15) ([Business Leaderboard - Substack](https://substack.com/leaderboard/business/paid#:~:text=Noahpinion,Richard)) ([This newsletter is growing up - by Lenny Rachitsky](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/this-newsletter-is-growing-up-#:~:text=Rachitsky%20www,is%20that%20if%20this)) – typically around $100–$150 per year for committed subscribers. These price points are still modest enough to attract a broad base, yet high-volume enough that with a few thousand paying users a writer can earn a comfortable income.

**Premium Tiers:** Some newsletters offer **“founder” or premium tiers** at higher rates for supporters. For instance, *Noahpinion* (economics writer Noah Smith) has a $420/year founding membership option ([Only fools think Elon is incompetent - by Noah Smith](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/only-fools-think-elon-is-incompetent?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=35345&post_id=157728665&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4NDYwMjAyMywicG9zdF9pZCI6MTU3NzI4NjY1LCJpYXQiOjE3NDAzMDEwNjksImV4cCI6MTc0Mjg5MzA2OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTM1MzQ1Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.9meSnH0KUuNQgI1KH5m_JLNKq1j2Y40Z39OagM6oRmk&r=1edbc7&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email#:~:text=Only%20fools%20think%20Elon%20is,of%20thousands%20of%20paid%20subscribers)), and *The Bulwark* offers a $300/year “Founders” tier in addition to its standard $100/year sub ([About Founding Memberships - The Bulwark](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/about-founding-memberships#:~:text=Right%20now%20you%27re%20a%20Bulwark%2B,called%20Founders%2C%20for%20%24300)). These higher tiers are usually optional and come with perks (shout-outs, exclusive Q&As, community access), providing an extra revenue boost from super-fans.

**High-Price Niches:** Notably, certain **finance and investment newsletters charge very high fees**, targeting a smaller professional audience. Substack’s *Finance* category contains some of the priciest publications. For example, *Citrini Research* (an investment analysis letter) charges about **£1,000/year (~$1,200)** for an annual subscription ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=titles%20pressgazette,1%2C200%29)). Another popular finance letter, *Doomberg* (a pseudonymous finance/energy analyst), only sells annual subscriptions around **$300/year** ([Finance Leaderboard - Substack](https://substack.com/leaderboard/finance/paid#:~:text=Finance%20Leaderboard%20,of%20paid%20subscribers%20%C2%B7%20%24300%2Fyear)). These premium publications often have “thousands” (not tens of thousands) of subscribers, but their revenue can rival the big mass-audience blogs thanks to the high price point. In fact, three of the four highest-charging Substack newsletters are in the finance category ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=The%20next%20highest,for%20a%20single%20annual%20subscription)). *Citrini Research*, with “thousands” of subscribers paying up to $1.2k each, easily surpasses $1 million in revenue, ranking among Substack’s top earners ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=The%20next%20highest,for%20a%20single%20annual%20subscription)).

**Revenue Estimates:** Substack’s model (90% to writers, 10% fee to Substack) means gross subscription revenue translates fairly directly to creator earnings (minus payment processing fees). Using the disclosed subscriber tiers and prices, Press Gazette and others have calculated **minimum revenue figures** for top newsletters. For example, *Letters from an American* at a minimum 200k paying × $50/yr suggests **>$10 million** gross (though the author only claims “at least” $5 million publicly as a conservative floor) ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=The%20Substack%20which%20topped%20Press,5m)). In 2023, the **top 27 Substack newsletters** were estimated to generate **over $22 million** combined ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=The%2027%20highest,revenue%2C%20Press%20Gazette%20can%20reveal)). By early 2025, the **top 10 alone** were reportedly bringing in **about $40 million/year** ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=This%20year%20that%20figure%20has,revenue%20publishers)). Individual success stories include tech writer Gergely Orosz, whose *Pragmatic Engineer* was making ~$1.5M annually by 2023 ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=joint,5m)), and politics writer Matt Yglesias, whose *Slow Boring* passed the $1M/year mark with ~13k subscribers as of late 2022 ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20The%20Washington%20Post%20,fee)) (now ~18k subs for ~$1.4M ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=,4m))). 

It’s important to note that these figures **exclude other revenue streams** some newsletters have. A few writers have attracted **sponsorships or advertising** deals (though Substack is primarily reader-supported). For instance, media newsletter *The Ankler* supplements subscription income with sponsorship sales – it reported seven-figure ad revenues in 2024 ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=However%2C%20Ankler%20chief%20executive%20Janice,captured%20in%20Press%20Gazette%E2%80%99s%20analysis)). Others have used Substack success to secure **venture funding**: Bari Weiss’s operation raised between $1–5 million from investors to expand *The Free Press* ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20Bari%20Weiss%2C%20the,earns%20at%20least%20%24800%2C000%20annually)). Nonetheless, subscription fees remain the core income source for most, and the **subscription business model on Substack has proven viable across scales** – from niche experts earning a healthy side income, to superstar writers now running multi-million-dollar enterprises.

## Notable Top Substack Newsletters (Case Studies)

To illustrate the diversity of successful Substack publications, here are some of the **top newsletters across different genres** and what makes them stand out:

- **Letters from an American** – *Heather Cox Richardson*, a history professor, provides daily essays interpreting U.S. political news through a historical lens. Her approachable, contextualized analysis struck a chord during turbulent times. By 2022–23 her newsletter became Substack’s largest, with well over a **million subscribers** (hundreds of thousands paying) ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=1)). Priced around $5/month, it offers incredible reach at a low cost. *Letters* reportedly generates at least **$5M/year** in revenue ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=The%20Substack%20which%20topped%20Press,5m)). Richardson’s work has been described as offering readers “a break from the media maelstrom,” which helped build trust and a loyal following ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=And%20by%20far%20the%20most,break%20from%20the%20media%20maelstrom%E2%80%9D)).

- **The Free Press** – Founded by journalist **Bari Weiss** in 2021, this newsletter grew into a full-fledged media outlet on Substack. It covers politics, culture, and news with a focus on free speech and debate. Weiss leveraged her notoriety and brought on other writers, turning *The Free Press* into a multi-writer publication. It has **136,000+ paying subscribers** ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=However%2C%20Cox%20Richardson%20now%20appears,its%20%2480%20yearly%20subscription%20price)), one of the largest on the platform, at ~$80/year. Weiss disclosed the publication was earning ~$80k in its *first week* and quickly scaled into the high six figures ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20Bari%20Weiss%2C%20the,earns%20at%20least%20%24800%2C000%20annually)); by 2024 it likely surpassed **$10M annual revenue**. *The Free Press* demonstrates how Substack can host an entire **independent newsroom**, not just individual creators.

- **The Pragmatic Engineer** – Written by **Gergely Orosz**, a former Uber engineer, this is Substack’s top *technology* newsletter ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=,per%20week)). It offers deep dives into software engineering practices, tech company insider trends, and career advice for engineers. Orosz’s insider credibility and actionable insights helped him amass **tens of thousands of paying subscribers** (out of ~574k total readers) ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=)). At $15/month or $150/year, his newsletter is on the higher end of pricing, but subscribers see it as an investment in their career. *The Pragmatic Engineer* pulls in an estimated **$1.5M+ per year** ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=joint,5m)), and was even featured by Bloomberg as a new kind of scooping tech journalism run by an individual. Orosz’s success shows demand for niche, professional content – readers will pay premium prices for specialized analysis they can’t get elsewhere.

- **Lenny’s Newsletter** – Created by **Lenny Rachitsky**, this weekly newsletter started as an advice column on product management and growth. It has since grown into a must-read in the tech/startup community, featuring interviews and how-to guides. Lenny’s approachable style and useful insights led to **over 380,000 free subscribers**, of which about **18,000 are paid** ([Paid Newsletter Deep Dive: How Lenny Rachitsky Gets 18k People to Pay for His Content - Growth in Reverse](https://growthinreverse.com/lennys-paid-newsletter/#:~:text=those%20people%20into%20paying%20customers)). At ~$15/month, he bundles perks like a subscriber-only community Slack, job boards, and even software discounts. By 2024, Lenny was making **over $2M annually** from subscriptions ([Paid Newsletter Deep Dive: How Lenny Rachitsky Gets 18k People to Pay for His Content - Growth in Reverse](https://growthinreverse.com/lennys-paid-newsletter/#:~:text=Lenny%20Rachitsky%20makes%20over%20%242,to%20his%20newsletter%20every%20year)) – far exceeding his previous tech salary. His growth playbook (consistent quality content, word-of-mouth, and converting just a few percent of a large free audience) has become a model for other Substack writers.

- **Slow Boring** – A politics and policy newsletter by **Matthew Yglesias** (co-founder of Vox). Yglesias was one of Substack’s early marquee recruits – he even received a reported $250k advance to launch on the platform ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20The%20Washington%20Post%20,fee)). *Slow Boring* offers daily commentary on U.S. policy debates, with an emphasis on data and pragmatism over partisanship. By late 2022 it had **13,000+ paying subscribers** ([Revealed: top 27 highest-earning Substacks generate over $22m a year](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/highest-earning-substacks/#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20The%20Washington%20Post%20,fee)) and now ~18,000 ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=,4m)), contributing to about **$1M+ in annual revenue**. Yglesias’s presence showed that established journalists could successfully break from mainstream outlets and **monetize their personal brand** on Substack. He also proved that readers would pay for wonky policy analysis if delivered with a strong, relatable voice.

- **House Inhabit** – A culture/celebrity investigative newsletter by **Jessica Reed Kraus**, *House Inhabit* rose to prominence with insider reporting on Hollywood scandals (like the Depp–Heard trial coverage that went viral) ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=20)). Kraus’s Substack became a top *Culture* publication, ranked #1 in that category ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=,per%20week)). With a mix of free and paid posts, she converted a sizable audience – “tens of thousands” of paying readers – and earns an estimated **$700k+ annually** ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=20)). This example shows that **entertainment and pop-culture journalism** also thrives on Substack, especially when it offers a perspective or access the traditional media lacks.

- **Your Local Epidemiologist** – An email that began during the COVID-19 pandemic by **Dr. Katelyn Jetelina**, translating public health data into plain language. It drew a large following for its clear, science-based updates. Even as the pandemic ebbed, the newsletter retained “tens of thousands” of paying subscribers ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=27)) out of ~220k total, and continues to cover public health issues. Priced accessibly (~$50/year), it earns on the order of **$500k–$1M per year** ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=27)). Along with similar health-focused letters (like *Unreported Truths* by Alex Berenson, *Dr. Mercola’s Censored Library*, etc.), this illustrates the demand for **health and science content** on Substack – including controversial or alternative viewpoints that found their audience online.

- **Steady** – A newsletter by veteran news anchor **Dan Rather** (with Elliott Kirschner), focusing on democracy and media commentary. Rather, at 91, proved Substack isn’t just for the young or tech-savvy – his trusted voice attracted over **200,000 subscribers** (with “tens of thousands” paid) ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=19)). *Steady* charges ~$5/month and makes at least **$500k/year** ([Substack User and Revenue Statistics (2024)](https://backlinko.com/substack-users#:~:text=Your%20Local%20Epidemiologist%20%24500%2C000%20The,500%2C000%20The%20North%20Star%20%24500%2C000)). It shows how established public figures can **extend their legacy and reach new generations** through email newsletters.

*(Many other successful Substacks could be noted – from finance analysis (*Doomberg*, *Citrini*) to sports and music – but the above examples give a flavor of the range in topic and style.)*

## Trends and Common Themes Among Top Newsletters

**1. Politics and Polarization Drive Subscriptions:** The politics category dominates Substack’s leaderboards. By revenue, U.S. politics is the single highest-earning genre – accounting for about **46%** of the top newsletters’ subscription revenue (roughly $18 million of the ~$40M among high earners) ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=By%20far%20the%20top,the%20group%20earn%20each%20year)). Out of the 29 most-subscribed Substack publications, 9 were in U.S. politics (about 31%) ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications)). Polarized political climates tend to produce engaged readers: people seek out voices that align with or challenge their views, and they are willing to pay for independent perspectives ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20surprisingly%20that,more%20moderate%20or%20balanced%20content)). Substack’s political writers span the spectrum – from progressive (e.g. *Zeteo* by Mehdi Hasan) to conservative (e.g. *The Dispatch*, *The Federalist* writers) to heterodox (Taibbi, Greenwald, etc.). Many launched after feeling constrained by traditional media, and found receptive audiences on Substack. This trend echoes a broader shift toward **direct-to-reader journalism** in the face of mainstream media fragmentation.

**2. Other Strong Categories – Finance, Tech, and Health:** After politics, **finance** newsletters generate the next highest incomes on average ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=The%20next%20highest,for%20a%20single%20annual%20subscription)). Investors and professionals are willing to pay high subscription fees for actionable market insights (e.g. finance letters often charge $30–$100+ per month). The *Finance* category’s top Substacks like *Citrini Research* and *Doomberg* are pulling in six to seven figures with only a few thousand subscribers, thanks to premium pricing ([Finance Leaderboard - Substack](https://substack.com/leaderboard/finance/paid#:~:text=Finance%20Leaderboard%20,of%20paid%20subscribers%20%C2%B7%20%24300%2Fyear)) ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=The%20next%20highest,for%20a%20single%20annual%20subscription)). **Technology and business** newsletters are also prominent. Tech-focused publications (engineering, startups, crypto) attract broad global readerships – for example, *ByteByteGo* (tech education) has 500k total subscribers ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=8)), *Not Boring* by Packy McCormick (tech/finance) and *Noahpinion* (econ/tech) each have tens of thousands of readers. These often monetize at $10–$15/month levels, and some have become lucrative (e.g. *Noahpinion* reportedly has “tens of thousands” paying ~$50–$60/year ([The Internet Archive loses its appeal of a US district court ruling that ...](https://www.techmeme.com/240904/p38#:~:text=,to%20%2460%20a%20year))). **Health and science** is another notable genre: several top earners sprung up during COVID and tapped into the hunger for science commentary (some, like Berenson and Mercola, specifically cater to contrarian viewpoints, showing that **controversy can drive subscriptions** too). Lastly, **culture, food, and entertainment** have their share of hits – from Alison Roman’s cooking newsletter (*A Newsletter*) making ~$500k ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=21)), to music and lifestyle writers who’ve amassed large followings. In short, *successful Substack newsletters span a wide range of topics*, but they tend to be areas where the author has a distinct expertise or angle and where a community can form around that content.

**3. Established Voices and Credibility:** A common thread is that many top Substack writers brought an **existing audience or reputation**. Big-name journalists (e.g. Glenn Greenwald, Andrew Sullivan, Anne Helen Petersen) and public intellectuals (e.g. historian Heather Cox Richardson, economist Robert Reich) had built trust and followings before Substack, which converted into instant subscriber bases. For instance, UK writer **Emma Gannon** had 26,000 subscribers on Substack and noted how it enabled writers like her to “thrive” and get paid fairly ([The End of the Subscription Era is Coming | by Nick Hilton | Medium](https://nickfthilton.medium.com/the-end-of-the-subscription-era-is-coming-ed197f252c6a#:~:text=businesses%20themselves%2C%20but%20the%20would,just%20a%20nice%20to%20have%E2%80%9D)). That said, there are also breakout stars who *built their brand on Substack itself* (Lenny Rachitsky, Jessica Kraus, etc.) – but even they typically filled a **void in existing coverage** or addressed a niche passionately, thereby attracting word-of-mouth growth. Credibility and consistency are crucial for convincing readers to subscribe.

**4. Free Content as a Funnel:** Virtually all top newsletters use a **freemium model**, offering substantial content for free to grow their list. On average, the ratio of free to paid subscribers is high – often 5:1 or 10:1 (i.e. only 10–20% of total subscribers pay) ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=)) ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=)). For example, *Popular Information* (Judd Legum’s politics newsletter) has ~300k total subscribers but “tens of thousands” paid (perhaps ~10%) ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=18)). *Lenny’s Newsletter* converts ~4–5% of readers to paid ([Paid Newsletter Deep Dive: How Lenny Rachitsky Gets 18k People to Pay for His Content - Growth in Reverse](https://growthinreverse.com/lennys-paid-newsletter/#:~:text=those%20people%20into%20paying%20customers)). The large free audience not only serves as a pool for upselling to paid, but also helps spread the newsletter via referrals and Substack’s network. **Substack’s recommendation features** allow authors to recommend other newsletters, which can boost discovery. Many successful writers deliberately keep some posts free (e.g. one free post per week) to keep expanding their reach. The key is balancing free value with premium perks to entice upgrades. As one analysis noted, offering plenty of free content can actually *increase* paid sign-ups over time by vastly enlarging the funnel ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=More%20free%20subscribers%20leads%20to,more%20paid%20subscribers%2C%20too)).

**5. Frequent Publishing and Engagement:** Top Substack publications tend to publish **frequently and regularly**. A study of popular newsletters found the majority post *multiple times per week* ([Which Substack Publications Have the Most Subscribers (And What We Can Learn from Them)](https://www.reallygoodbusinessideas.com/p/most-popular-substack-publications#:~:text=Last%20week%20we%20noted%20that,publications%20are%20publishing%20even%20more)), which keeps subscribers engaged and willing to pay. In fact, among newsletters with >200k subscribers, almost all published at least weekly and most several times a week. Frequent publishing not only provides more value to subscribers but also increases the newsletter’s visibility (each post is a chance for sharing or going viral). Many authors also send **free “preview” posts or podcasts** to entice free readers to subscribe. Additionally, successful newsletters often foster a community feeling – through comments sections, subscriber-only discussion threads, or live chats. Substack’s platform supports these features, and writers who actively engage with their audience (answering questions, hosting subscriber calls, etc.) build loyalty that translates to higher retention. The **result is strong subscriber retention rates** for top newsletters; many have low churn because they become part of readers’ routines and communities.

**6. Global and Diverse Reach:** While a significant share of Substack’s biggest names are U.S.-focused, the platform’s growth is global. Writers from the UK, Canada, Australia, India, and beyond have thriving newsletters. Local news ventures have even sprung up (e.g. *The Manchester Mill* in the UK built a sustainable local journalism model on Substack) ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=sponsorships%2C%20which%20cannot%20be%20captured,in%20Press%20Gazette%E2%80%99s%20analysis)). Substack’s **top categories** include not just U.S. politics but also international affairs (for instance, *Sinocism* by Bill Bishop covers China and has thousands of paid readers), finance (often global markets), and technology (a global industry). Non-English Substacks remain a smaller portion, but there are successful ones in French, Spanish, etc., indicating the model can work in different languages and markets. The commonality is that people worldwide are willing to pay for quality content directly from creators, especially as trust in traditional media wanes.

**7. Sustainability and Future Trends:** With over 17,000 writers now earning money on Substack ([Substack User and Revenue Statistics (2024)](https://backlinko.com/substack-users#:~:text=,make%20%2425%20million%20per%20year)), it’s clear that the newsletter model is not a fluke – though it may be entering a more mature phase. There are warnings that with so many subscription products now (newsletters, streaming services, etc.), consumers will only maintain a limited number at once ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=platform%20as%20a%20supplement%20to,their%20main%20income)). This could mean competition for the subscriber dollar will intensify. Top newsletters are beginning to differentiate by offering **bundled value** – for example, Lenny’s Newsletter adds perks like free access to partner software for annual subscribers, and some authors collaborate to offer joint subscription deals. We also see Substack itself evolving (introducing podcast feeds, chat communities, and even a new recommendation feed called Substack Notes) to increase engagement and discovery. The most successful newsletters are essentially **personal media brands** at this point, and some may expand off-platform (books, events, courses, etc.). Nevertheless, the core formula that emerged in 2020–2022 – an email newsletter with a strong authorial voice, supported directly by readers – remains the blueprint for success.

## Conclusion

In summary, Substack’s last three years have demonstrated that a **direct-to-consumer publishing model** can support journalism, commentary, and niche writing at scale. Dozens of writers now earn six or seven figures annually on the platform ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=This%20year%20that%20figure%20has,revenue%20publishers)), covering topics from U.S. elections to software engineering to cooking. The most successful newsletters typically combine **compelling content, a loyal audience, consistent output, and smart monetization** via tiered subscriptions. They have capitalized on readers’ willingness to pay for independent voices and specialized knowledge. This has allowed individual creators around the world to build media businesses of their own. 

Looking ahead, Substack’s top newsletters offer a glimpse into changing media consumption habits: people are curating their information diet by subscribing to individuals who inform and engage them. The breadth of topics thriving on Substack – politics, finance, tech, health, culture, and more – suggests that **readers globally have an appetite for quality content in many domains**, not just the traditional news beats. As the ecosystem matures, we may see further professionalization (multi-person newsrooms like *The Free Press* or *The Bulwark* becoming more common) and possibly more competition among newsletters. But for now, the trend is clear: **the newsletter renaissance** is in full swing, and Substack’s leading lights are turning their personal passions into profitable, reader-powered publications ([The End of the Subscription Era is Coming | by Nick Hilton | Medium](https://nickfthilton.medium.com/the-end-of-the-subscription-era-is-coming-ed197f252c6a#:~:text=The%20question%20is%20not%20%E2%80%9Ccan,more%20than%20%2425m%20last%20year)) ([The End of the Subscription Era is Coming | by Nick Hilton | Medium](https://nickfthilton.medium.com/the-end-of-the-subscription-era-is-coming-ed197f252c6a#:~:text=But%20if%20the%20Top%2010,broadcasting%20to%20next%20to%20nobody)).

Substack’s internal metrics (as of early 2025) indicate strong growth in both free readership and paid subscriptions, with top publications now earning in the millions of dollars range ([Biggest Substack newsletters: Ranking of top paid titles](https://pressgazette.co.uk/newsletters/biggest-substack-newsletters-2025/#:~:text=This%20year%20that%20figure%20has,revenue%20publishers)). The trends and examples highlighted reflect the state of Substack’s ecosystem circa 2022–2025, illustrating how a wide variety of writers have achieved success on the platform.
